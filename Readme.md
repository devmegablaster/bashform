## Installation

There is no installation required for using Bashform. As long as you have SSH access, you can:

- Create forms
- Respond to forms
- Get form responses

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> You need an SSH key to use bashform. If you don't have one (WHY?), you can generate one using the following command:
>
> ```bash
> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<your_email>"
> ```

### Fill Out a Form

To fill out a form, use the following command:

```bash
ssh -t bashform.me form <code>
# or
ssh -t bashform.me f <code>
```

Replace `<code>` with the unique code of the form you wish to fill out.

### Create a New Form

To create a new form, use the command:

```bash
ssh -t bashform.me create <num_of_questions> <code>
# or
ssh -t bashform.me c <num_of_questions> <code>
```

Replace `<num_of_questions>` with the number of questions you want in the form, and `<code>` with the unique code for your form.

```bash
ssh -t bashform.me form myform
```

This allows you to respond to the form with the code `myform`.

### Getting Form Responses

```bash
ssh -t bashform.me forms
```
